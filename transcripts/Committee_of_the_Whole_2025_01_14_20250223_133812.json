  "content": "Speaker A: Thank you very much. This is the meeting at the RM of Springfield. The meeting agenda is a committee of the whole on January 14th of 2025 at exactly 1pm I'm going to call the meeting to order. I'd like to do some introductions as well, please. We have Roxanne and Christy on the front desk there handling the the WI fi component. And we have our CEO, Colleen Draper, myself, I'm mayor Patrick Katerian for the arm of Springfield. In the sending order is deputy mayor Glenn Fuel. Also ward one. Next will be councillor. Ward two is Andy Kaczynski. Next is. Do we know if Mark's here? Mark is not here right now, but if he comes in, we'll notify you accordingly. Next is Ward 4, Councillor Melinda Warren, who is on WI fi. And then at this time here, I'd like to go to item number three, approval of the agenda. Can I move her in a seconder please? Glenn and Andy, any additions or Mark or. I'm sorry, Andy.\n\nSpeaker B: I would like to ask item 8.3, financial update and close meeting. This doesn't fit in the criteria to be in a closed meeting for today meeting. So can we remove it and put on agenda and regular item.\n\nSpeaker C: So this. This is not a public document yet. So it can be shared with council and closed meeting and it will become public at the January 21st council meeting.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, so if we cannot have it in a closed meeting, can we remove it from the agenda and have been presented to the council at the other than this council meeting?\n\nSpeaker C: So just to be clear, the residents and obviously the public don't know what you're referring to. This is a copy of the draft 2023 audited financial statement. So it has to be tabled at the first regular council meeting, which is January 21st, and that's when it becomes a public document. So up until then, if council wants to discuss it and our finance department wants to discuss it with council, it has to be done in closed meeting because it's still considered private and confidential.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: Thank you. Anything else? Approval of the agenda, additions, modifications at all? I see none. Then can I get a show of hands of those in support of the approval of the agenda? That is unanimous and is carried. Then we'll go to approval of the minutes. That's item number four. Can I get a mover in a seconder? Patrick and Glenn, any questions from council with regards to the to the minutes? I see none. Then if I get a show of hands of those in support of the approval of the minutes for 12-10-2024 that is unanimous and is carried have no delegations. Unfinished business. We'll go to 7.1 and that is the recreational center project update. Do we need to move my second for that then? If Sean, if you don't.\n\nSpeaker D: Thank you. Yes. We're here to talk about the Springfield Community Recreation Center. So based on direction from council administration has been working with Ella Market Tech Group to phase in the Springfield Community Recreation center project into two different phases. Phase one, proposed project budget of 20.625 million will feature a gymnasium, multi purpose room, indoor walking, jogging track, indoor playground, indoor turf, team rooms and a community kitchen. The facility will focus on supporting various community user groups as well as municipal operated programs. So the gym and community hall would accommodate a variety of multi use activities including basketball, volleyball, Bamington pickleball, summer camps, drop in activities and community special events. The multipurpose rooms can be converted into two rooms if required. The multipurpose rooms can be used for summer camps, art programs, workshop, birthday parties, meetings and fitness classes. The indoor walking running track will have three lanes situated on the mezzanine floor above the community gymnasium. Eight laps around the track will equal 1 km. The indoor playground the proposed indoor playground will be situated on the main floor and allow traffic for unstructured play. The administrative offices will host the community service department. Phase two will include the indoor turf and fitness center. The indoor turf facility would accommodate such sports as indoor soccer, flag football, football training, ultimate frisbee, baseball, softball training and lawn bowling and lawn bowling. Building components have been selected based on a community feedback discussed during the recreation master plan process and open houses held by the LM Architect group. The purpose to complete the process to complete the Springfield Recreation master plan included six community conversations, two surveys, stakeholder meetings and three open houses. In addition, we had five recreation center open houses with the Allen group with the sixth one being on January 30th. We've had a fundraising committee in place for the last two years. Their goal is to raise $4 million and they're all volunteers who donate their time to raise money to reduce funds, to reduce funds, to reduce the boring bylaw and to raise funds for the project. Now I'll turn over to Amran who will discuss the financing portion of the rec center.\n\nSpeaker E: Good afternoon Mayor Pat and council. In terms of financing for phase one for the project, we're looking at a total project cost of $20,625,000. And of that funding that have been secured to date is grant funding from the province of $4.7 million. And there is also internal funds from reserves that have been identified. Management and council have identified these funds of above $4 million for the project. And with that phase one funding, we're looking at borrowing $11.9 million to fund the project for phase one. In terms of full build, the total project cost estimates that we have currently is $30.6378 million. And with the same existing funding that we've identified for phase one borrowing for that full build will be $21.9 million. Those are the funding available currently for the project that have been considered. Thank you, ma'am.\n\nSpeaker A: Thank you. Amram, any questions so far from the council?\n\nSpeaker B: Andy, I would like to ask from which accounts do we gonna get this funding from Rural Municipality Reserve towards this project?\n\nSpeaker A: Amra.\n\nSpeaker E: So Councillor Andy, the total reserves that we've identified of $4 million plus we've identified this from a couple of reserves. The Springfield Recreation Reserve, Springfield Community center. Sorry Reserve, the Parks and Facility Reserve, the Dedication Reserve and then there is an amount also coming from the general fund reserve. All of these make up $4,023,558.\n\nSpeaker A: That's on page four of our our report to to council, right?\n\nSpeaker E: It's on.\n\nSpeaker C: Yeah, it's under the funding sources document.\n\nSpeaker E: Yes, the funding sources documents on the agenda. That's where we'll see those figures.\n\nSpeaker A: Any other questions?\n\nSpeaker B: Yes. So it was said that we supposed to get some money or $4 million from Grassroots Group. Are we going to receive that money or not?\n\nSpeaker D: Yes, Council. So the goal is 4 million. So we have raised about 47% of that 4 million. Some of it were received, some of it is commitments.\n\nSpeaker F: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker B: So we don't have it yet.\n\nSpeaker D: We have some of it, not all of it. Some of them are commitments that those organizations have made. I think some of the organizations are waiting to see how the project proceeds. Like if the boring bylaw is passed by council.\n\nSpeaker B: But can you guarantee that we're going to get that formally or not? Really?\n\nSpeaker D: We have confirmation from them to date.\n\nSpeaker F: So.\n\nSpeaker B: So if we don't get this $4 million, then how our finances gonna be borrowing money?\n\nSpeaker D: Well, I mean the goal is. I mean we have a volunteer committee and their goal is to raise that money to reduce the boring bylaw.\n\nSpeaker C: So I think maybe we can note that like Amram noted that there's 11.9 million proposed to be borrowed. That's only factoring the fundraising that we've received to date so that 11.9 can be reduced further while the build is happening to reduce that borrowing with Additional fundraising that comes in and we're always.\n\nSpeaker D: Looking for grants as well to reduce that boring bylaw. So that is the goal, to make that boring bylaw as small as possible.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, thank you, Glenn.\n\nSpeaker G: Just confirming. So we're around the two million dollar mark raised.\n\nSpeaker D: Yeah, I think 1.7 in commitment.\n\nSpeaker G: That's great. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: I just had a comment there. I just want to put a, a, a high praise to our volunteer group headed by Mike Witzkowitz there. And I apologize, I don't know everybody's name, but they know who they are. And Mike couldn't be here for this there. But these people do it.\n\nSpeaker F: It's.\n\nSpeaker A: There's no fee there. They're doing it as an initiative for the RM, which is. Sadly, it's been 32 years since the old rec center was taken down. I think it was an old church or, or something there. I remember it there when the kids were younger. So this has been in discussion for seven councils in that time. And it's time that we get the rec center for our community and our citizens there. I got a question for, for Sean. I think I know the answer, but it's just for the people here. This, this, the rec center itself will allow the SCI to have the graduation ceremonies here as opposed to going into the city. It's large enough for that.\n\nSpeaker D: Yeah, I mean, it would be their choice, but I mean, yeah, we would.\n\nSpeaker A: Love to host them. Oh yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, thank you very much. And the two different versions that we have is with the turf rooms we had discussed this and building out and having the infrastructure there ready for the, for the turf whenever that phase two is, is prepared to go. But we do have both builds noted here and the cost there. So good job on, on, on the details here. Unless there's any other questions, I don't see any from Deputy Mayor. Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker G: Yeah, I'm going to jump in there for one more minute. Sean, another question I have for you is maybe we can talk about the field that'll be next door to it, where the turf was to be built. My understanding is we're looking at maybe an outdoor field during the summertime to do events on and some programming.\n\nSpeaker D: Yeah, it could be a nice addition to the community. It would be an open space that we could use for soccer, for community events, as you met, as you mentioned. Yeah, I mean, we do lack green space in this municipality, so it will be a nice addition.\n\nSpeaker G: Great.\n\nSpeaker A: Thank you, Colleen.\n\nSpeaker C: Yeah, so I just want to go over kind of next steps with the project note now, so Obviously council met recently with staff from LM Architecture. We reviewed kind of the project, the different phases. We're preparing for the open house on January 6th that will be at the municipal office between 6 and 8pm we're hoping to have updated storyboards and possibly a video if we're able to. And we'll be able to go through the different phasing financial options that council had to consider. Obviously we're still fundraising, still looking for federal and provincial grants. So if we're successful that project could expand if we get the funding available. So that's always an option we're keeping in our back pocket. Right now we're working on the proposed borrowing bylaw and if we kind of have final decisions by council we could be holding that borrowing bylaw public hearing early February.\n\nSpeaker A: February. Thank you very much. Melinda.\n\nSpeaker C: Hi. Can I just remind everyone that there is more fundraising and I believe that there is another fundraiser in February. If Sean could maybe say something about that or somebody. Yeah, we know there is an event coming up. We just don't have the details to share right now. So as soon as we have those details worked out, we'll definitely be advertising. So yeah, there are events being planned. Okay, thanks.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. There's no other questions. I see none. Then we'll prepare to move on to 7.2. And that's the cordite hillside gravel pit lease extension discussion. Gary, did you want to do this? I just kidding you, Wayne.\n\nSpeaker F: Good afternoon council. Happy New Year. Haven't seen anybody yet.\n\nSpeaker A: Happy New Year.\n\nSpeaker F: Yeah. So as you're where Glacial had entered into a lease agreement for our hillside court I pit this would have been back September 2023 with a five year lease agreement with a two year option which was approved by council for the, the five year lease. Glacial has since just before the Christmas break approached myself wanting to exercise the, the final two years extension for those, those two pit lease locations. So in short that's kind of what we're here for is to see if there's appetite to move on this. There is a table within the, within the lease agreement for the 29 and 30 years, 29 and 30s that they have option on and have value to. I don't. No council wants to be in that. It's. It's only an option if this is something that we want to negotiate further. Stay status quo.\n\nSpeaker A: I'm not sure what do you mean by status quo. Just not entertain it yet with the option.\n\nSpeaker F: Yeah, we can look at just keeping the five year for now as an option. We can look at Entertaining those last two years, that gives us future funding, security on those. On those pit leases.\n\nSpeaker A: What's your thoughts on it, Blaine?\n\nSpeaker F: I don't really have any concerns on it. I think memory serves when we brought this forward as the last two year lease options, it was advantageous to us. Also advantageous to glacial as well. So they know what. What they got in store for the next few years. And then we also know what kind of revenue, additional revenue we have coming in for the next. Well, in this case, probably the next five years. So I don't see any real concerns with it, but I just want to make sure council is got all the information moving forward if we want to sit down with them. Not sit down with them.\n\nSpeaker A: I got some thoughts there, but I'll put it out. The council, their thoughts, Vinnie.\n\nSpeaker G: Just clarification, Blaine. They approached us for the option side.\n\nSpeaker F: That's correct, yes.\n\nSpeaker G: Okay. I don't see a problem with it. I guess the question is, is that, you know, we went to put the option in there in the first place. If we weren't interested, I would say so. I really don't have a concern unless you had a concern because you're the one, as the director working with all this every day. So if you don't have no concerns. I have no concerns.\n\nSpeaker F: I have no. Again, I think you're correct in saying we looked at this and we entertained it back in 2023 and had no concerns with those two additional option years. It was just more of a matter of when they wanted to bring that forward, which they're doing now. So I have no. I have no concerns moving forward.\n\nSpeaker A: Thank you, Melinda. Andy.\n\nSpeaker F: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker B: In the meeting, you told her that there was not too many people making bids for this option. Yeah. So. So now their companies was, you know, go. Coming forward, you know, to proceed with the.\n\nSpeaker F: Yeah, you're right. We don't have a. Be honest. We don't have anybody knocking at our door for these lease options. We have a Maple Leaf that has been in our Pine Ridge pit location for, God, 15 years probably. So they're quite content and they got a pretty big area to deal with there. So other than Maple leaf and glacial, nobody's been knocking at our door. So in some ways it's, you know, it's hard to turn a blind eye on when, you know, you got security there. So.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, thank you, Blaine.\n\nSpeaker A: What's our life expectancy of that pit? I saw the aerial, the package and so on like that there. It's. What is it mean? Idea or.\n\nSpeaker F: Well, I mean, Life expectancy is, you know, I can always come back to you with, with the volumes of, of that can be taken out of there. But life expectancy really comes down to how much material they'll be pulling out of there every year. So right now we have minimums of the cordate is 50,000 cubic yards and 25,000 on the hillside. That gets you a lot of years. There's a, you know, cordate's still a fairly big pit. Footprint of a pit hillside, not so much. But if they started pulling out 200,000 yards a year, well, it's going to deplete a lot quicker. Right now, past history showing that they're, they're over, over their minimums, but not by, not by that much. So I would suspect there's many years there left. Well, in this case, you know, in 2023 we went in and they were confident on a seven year for both of them. So they're going to know their business a lot better than we will and what their needs are going to be going forward.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. There was something in here about a topographical survey that was to be done by the end of November there. Do you recall something about that?\n\nSpeaker F: Yep. Every, if I go through it, it's every second year or prior to the start of a new lease, there would be a top crack local ceremony done to establish what that footprint looks like and then any changes after that. When we bring the legals in, then they evaluate how much actual material was pulled out and that gets vetted against what they submit for their reports. So kind of cross check, if you want to look at it that way.\n\nSpeaker A: Who pays for that, by the way? The topographical survey, is that us that pays for that?\n\nSpeaker F: No, that would be all on the lessee.\n\nSpeaker A: I guess it's a learning question too. How much, how much do they usually charge for something like that? Like a ballpark?\n\nSpeaker F: Well, nowadays it's drone. Right. So it's definitely boots on the ground quicker. I would venture to guess it's probably in that vicinity of 25 to $4,500.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. Okay. Any other questions?\n\nSpeaker B: Andy Brain, do we specify what depth they can go to?\n\nSpeaker F: Yes, again, in the, in the overall report. They cannot go any. There's an actual elevation in there, but they cannot go any, any deeper than the existing floor that we have established. Now if they wanted to, they have to come back and seek permission from the municipality. So nobody's ever asked us to go below that other than, you know, if they didn't need to do, do some. If you need water for screening or such, but there is no mining below.\n\nSpeaker B: The existing floor level and we checking on that or.\n\nSpeaker F: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker C: I'll just note that counselor Miller is joined on Zoom now, so I'm not sure if he has any questions regarding the cordite hillside gravel pit lease.\n\nSpeaker H: No question.\n\nSpeaker F: Thanks Pauline.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay then there's no other questions. Thank you very much. Blaine, I guess you want to kind of have an idea from council with regards to that there. I. I haven't got a problem with the option years there.\n\nSpeaker F: It's.\n\nSpeaker A: It's been worked out calculated for the two years. It's good for them and if it's good for us. Uh, would the council be in agreement with that the general idea for. For Blaine?\n\nSpeaker F: Well I think you'd probably calling me probably put this to resolution on the 21st.\n\nSpeaker C: Yeah, I'm just gonna have to read the. The agreement here and see what kind of the conditions were to act on that extension. But I would just prefer a council resolution agreeing to the. The two additional years.\n\nSpeaker F: I'll draft one up then send it over. Long as I just. So I have a bit of that direction today moving forward.\n\nSpeaker A: Andy, did you want to go in on this? You got no problems with it? Okay. All right then. Thank you very much, Blaine. Appreciate that. 7.3 is the active transportation overall planning? I guess.\n\nSpeaker F: Yes. So council this is just. I'm going to show a couple maps here. Both bank and Dugald just showing some what we have currently for active transportation pathways and trails and some of our proposed. So I believe the purple sections this will be Oak Bank. So purple sections are what is existing and the yellow is going to be what we're looking at proposing for future. So as we know we're. We're applying for grant funding in any opportunity we can for active transportation. We also have an annual proposed capital budget.\n\nSpeaker D: Right here.\n\nSpeaker F: And then here's Google for what we're working on. So it's really just kind of a bit of a high level just so council kind of sees where we're trying to do these the connectivities whether it's between developments or communities. Not so much in communities yet but definitely within development to development as we. As we grow in our communities here. So.\n\nSpeaker A: I just couldn't get mine my map the right size there but. Any questions from council?\n\nSpeaker B: So how are we going to proceed with the priorities like I guess whatever it's inside the op bank and Dougal, I think the that should be done first. Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker F: So we have a bit of our suggested priorities and any time council. But then again, that's. I want to kind of show you the, the mapping. So if we take a look at Oak bank, we already applied for a. Through the Grow program for. Is it grow program going? Yeah, for the active transportation and road reconstruction along Cypress Avenue, Oakwood and Pine Drive, I believe it was. So if we look at. You can see Cypress there in yellow. That's our proposed active transportation there. As long as on Oakwood there we show it. Pine Drive shows it purple right now. But there is a reconstruction needs to be done there. So we've tied that all into one grant application. So that would be our, you know, whether we're, you know, whether we get funded for it or not. That would be our priorities to start an old bank. And there's, there's other opportunities for grants. We've got a kind of segue into the next item here, but it's through the climate. What's the name of that one? Climate and.\n\nSpeaker C: Mute myself. Climate Action Fund.\n\nSpeaker F: Climate Action Fund, which is a provincial one as well. So that one there, we can't stack that against the Grow Fund opportunity. So we're going to look at pitching something in Google which would be the connection between. Our hope is to be the connection between the library and Wheatland. So we've done a fair bit of. Of work on that crossing to get across the rail tracks to get to the library and we've got a lot of consulting done and that a lot of surveying. But if this is, again, this is an opportunity, we can go through this application fund that might be successful for us. On top of that, there's a federal fund through the active transportation program that is stackable. So again, you could have that opportunity to take this project provincially and federally and stack them both together. So we are applying for that one as well. Those one, the, the climate one is due Monday and the Other one is February 26th. We will probably need resolution on both of those, Colleen, but we can send in the resolution at a later date and then from there, you know, everything starts tying together. Our next priority in Duval could be the along pth 15 that ties in from the plow lane to the curling club there and has a crosswalk with proposed illuminated lights at Gillespie. So then it starts interconnecting everything and I guess one of the ones we'll have to look at down the road is a Jaffrey. If it's a. That's something that council is going to have an appetite for on Jaffrey. It's a. Another pathway it's going to be. It's going to be tight to put a pathway in there same as Cypress. You'll have to put a most likely a land drainage system area that right in the ditch and use that utilize that space for the walkway. If you want to see an example of it you can go down Willow just going west of Balsam on the north side. We did that a few years ago. So that's. So I just kind of want to give. Give council a bit of an idea of where what we're working on how we're trying to fund some of this. Some of these programs and projects and for successful we're going to be busy.\n\nSpeaker B: So these projects are like territory Terry, cost sharing or I haven't in the.\n\nSpeaker F: Application under federal they haven't shown us the. The sharing compound or of that we're not sure on that one. The other ones are 5050 so we're hoping federal. Federal is usually 60, 40, 70, 30 sometimes. So that's a really good one if we can get on it but we won't know that one. That's a longer and bigger application process. It's quite in depth. So I think the first one is your application and there would be you go to the next step and then they would be that's where you see your funding.\n\nSpeaker B: So and what time frame we looking for this project?\n\nSpeaker F: I believe they the provincial one is a two year and I'm not sure on the federal one because it's not until February 2020 or February 26th this year. I would assume that one of the at least the two here as well but I can do follow up on that at a later date.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, thank you Blaine.\n\nSpeaker A: Mark had a question.\n\nSpeaker H: Thank you Mr. Mayor and great job, Blaine. I always am encouraged when you're going after these grants or are aware of them and I know the Climate Action Fund particularly is a very popular one. So having said that I would really encourage you to go after them. We can decide after the fact too as you say which ones are priority and or which ones we don't want to do. We don't have to accept the funds but at least we have our name in the. In the kitty. Just on actually on Monday the government of Canada ended the EV five thousand dollar rebate to citizens across Canada. So that was exhausted before the predicted date of March. So yeah if you can get those in as early as possible before they get exhausted. I mean again the problem that's a good problem to have right Is to how to spend money and on local projects so fantastic. I'm really encouraged to hear what you're doing.\n\nSpeaker F: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay.\n\nSpeaker A: Any other questions? Melinda? Okay, well, no other questions. Thank you very much. Blaine, are you up for the next one again? Yeah. So as, as I was, as I was talking, you're walking away.\n\nSpeaker F: Okay. Wa road again, this is a boundary road with Springfield and East St. Paul. It's I think I had it in there approximately 1.22. So they, again, they approached us. We're not surprised at the condition of that road. We've known about the road for number of years. There's some deterioration, it's an old road, there's some realignment issues, there's some drainage issues, what have you. So East St. Paul approached us last year. I guess they're kind of lining up to, to look at redoing this road. And of course being a boundary road and a good neighbor, they wanted to come to us first and say you guys got a bit of an appetite, you know, how do you want to share this project if going forward? So I believe right now they were undertaking all the survey and construction drawings for that. So I'm waiting for them to get back to us as far as cost, time frame, phasing, what have you. So I think the idea was to have in 2025 to do the engineering on it and then probably 26, 27 do the, do their the phases. So possibly one year would be base and ditch construction and last year would be hard surface. Now what type of hard surface we haven't discussed yet if it's going to be a chip seal or if it's going to be asphalt.\n\nSpeaker A: So would this be a good road for that? We did that course there on the cement, the rehab project and something or another that the corporation or the, the business there.\n\nSpeaker F: It, it possibly could be. I mean we've done our research on it, we've seen it done in bosses here. We heard guys go out and look at it. West there being that's a boundary road, we could talk to my peers over there and see if that's something they have an appetite for. But I think it's. If we were going to go that road, I'd really like to see a road or two done, you know, in our municipality and as a, as a first run basis and see how it really works for us. There's a lot of residences down that stretch. So let's say it would, it's going to fail. I just want to be sure that we're not going to put something that's not as superior as we think possibly. So I think there's some other, you know, higher traffic roads and traffic loading roads that we want to look at first.\n\nSpeaker G: Yeah. Being a boundary road, are we still able to go for grants on that also?\n\nSpeaker F: Yes.\n\nSpeaker G: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker F: Okay. Yeah. It would just be a shared application or depending on that grant, it's either shared or you'd have entered into a side agreement kind of like we did with Donaldson Drake.\n\nSpeaker G: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker F: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker B: We have not. The road that we're sharing with this St. Paul was a Wensall Road and apparently they didn't want to share on this project with us. And that's true.\n\nSpeaker F: That goes back a number of years ago. I. Without the actual documentation in front of my eyes, I'd probably prefer not to guess, but maybe not too far off. So that was when we did the seal coat on that. I believe it was. So that was gonna be 10 plus years ago, probably 15 years ago. So.\n\nSpeaker B: So they want to make that development there on Windsor Road. How that gonna work now? Are they going to be using our road and.\n\nSpeaker F: Well, there's definitely going to have to be some communication between the municipalities on that going forward. I haven't seen the drawings on that development, but I suspect either way it's going to add traffic loading to it. I mean, we used to be upwards of 1100 cars a day on Wenzel Road back before that perimeter went through. So now obviously without the golf course there and what have you, it's. It's dropped significantly. So it's just local traffic and it's. They've kind of made it kind of awkward to drive right through as a shortcut. So. But now if we're going to be putting extra traffic on there and so we know what development that's going to include heavy, heavy loading traffic. So.\n\nSpeaker B: Well, I see the, the plans, what they have that they want to put two villages there on the Wensaw Road side and then one south from our McGregor Farm Road.\n\nSpeaker F: Yeah, there's a lot of vacant land there. I know there's a two or three lot subdivision going on there right now.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker F: So that's already taken a bit of a toll on them because they're back in the day when they did the seal coat, there was no reconstruction of that subgrade done. So it was probably material put on top and then slow coated and that's. I'm not sure if that. That might have been Ian1 at the time too, probably. So there was some base structure done with that.\n\nSpeaker B: Nothing on talking about McGregor Farm Road and Wensaw There did we completed that project there to prevent flooding in that area for that one resident on the corner.\n\nSpeaker F: So we finished the ditching work there. Did we prevent flooding? That's up to Mother Nature. I think we've improved a lot of the low water to get that water out of there. But you still going to have long term maintenance. The run along McGregor Farm Road where it discharges onto 59 highway, it's very low grade. That whole area. I mean it's a bowl there. Everything comes to a bowl so it can only get out as fast as the downstream will let it out. So it's going to be up to maintenance from now on to keep, you know, people rushes out and. But it's not our jurisdiction so we're going to have to include East St. Paul on this one as well whenever there's maintenance to do.\n\nSpeaker B: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: I think that's actually it. Blaine, any other questions at all? I see none. Well, thank you very much. Finally. Yeah, one more thing, Blaine. Okay, then we're on item eight and that's a close meeting. Can I get a mover in a second or to go into a close meeting, Glenn and Andy, and at this point here, I'm gonna have to ask everybody and apart from staff to exit there. The time being is 1:41. Can I get a show of hands of those in support and as unanimous and as carried. Thank you. The time is 2:08pm we're returning from a closed meeting. Can I get a mover in a secondary please? Glenn and Patrick. And get a show of hands of those in support from coming out of the the closed meeting as unanimous and it is carried. And then we're going to go straight to the adjournment. Again, the mover and a secretary, Andy and Patrick. And at this point here, I'm going to close the meeting at exactly 2 8pm thank you very."
