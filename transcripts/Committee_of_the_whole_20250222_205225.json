If Tuesday isn't going to be a suitable day because of conflict with other things, maybe council reviews their organizational bylaw and changes the date they meet to Wednesday, for example, like other municipalities.

We answered Mr. Page's comments last time there and I'll answer them again. The points made are minutes are not a legal document and are not laid out the way they that way in the Municipal Act. Municipal act only references that the CEO must ensure that the minutes of every council meeting are made without note or comment. Minutes should be verbatim and that they should not reference individual points made, personal observations or opinions made by council members. Minutes should not record a debate on the outcome. Decisions, resolutions, reports and documents attached to the agenda show the information that was considered leading to the decision made. Question period should not be on the agenda. Personal opinions, judgments or comments made by the attendees should should be avoided and not included in the minutes. As for your your comments there November 14th, I guess we, we now know it's the 12th. So you know, you notice you note in dark blue or additional materials and comments to consider. That's not up to you, Mr. Page, to make those additions to that. We looked at the minutes there and the minutes as per our Municipal Service Officer. They're fine with me and have been for the two years that we've been here, plus many, many years before that. That we're not going to change the aspect of the minutes. The minutes are just that. They're just a scope of what was reiterated on a certain minute of meetings or one meeting in this case here. And the change it now I think is no is not something we want to do. Spelling errors, although it should be avoided, is at the very best a point. It does not take away from the meaning unless this is a legal document, something like a search warrant or warrant to obtain and so on like that. Spelling errors are critical. This doesn't rise to that occasion. I hope that ANSWERS your question, Mr. Page.",

The first set of blue text just for context for council, that's justifications for the changes needed on my question period comments because they are inaccurate and they make a logical lot make a lot of logical assumptions that aren't actually true. And likewise you wouldn't know what document I was talking about if you actually looked at the segment that's actually there. And it twists a couple of things I did say. That's just a matter of truth. The second set of blue comments, those are ones just meant to help because there's comments, there's just lack of information on those components.

So we have a minute book. A minute book is a legal instrument that is a record of a recorded meeting. So I would differ with what was just explained and I would say that minutes are absolutely critical in being accurate, precise and just. And so yeah, my point of view is just one shared amongst five people here, but I think they could be enhanced and I really, really appreciate you taking the time and effort to submit your corrections to council because I think it'll also stand as a record and it should be tabled and put as A record for what the public has seen in this case. But minutes can always be improved. You know, the old moral of teaching as you know for things like this is record less and then you have less to be accountable for. I don't like that motto. I think you should record more and provide more detail and precision to, to really give the tone. As you said you felt that you were misrepresented. I know in 7.3 as well. I think some of my points weren't captured because I don't know that I think there is misrepresentation of information out there. But it goes on both sides. Right. You can't just accuse one side of providing misinformation when. Because it becomes very biased and very. How can I say one sided and so. Absolutely.

So while attending the Manitoba Association Chiefs of Police fall meeting, a company called Forest Green did a presentation and they provide solutions to police just to help us do our job better. One of the programs they pitched was a safe neighborhood camera registry program. So what it does is provides a link onto the RM's website where residents can go on onto the secure login information. They'd have that and then they could whether or not they have a public facing camera and whether or not they're willing to share that information with police should a crime occur in that area. So the police would have the login and we would get little bubbles all over the RM showing where a camera is and that would limit our time going door to door to, you know, do knock and talks to see if cameras are available. And I had an incident with this over the weekend about a missing person and we spent about two and a half hours going door to door Oak Bank. So this could limit some of that time and just go to targeted houses. That could help. It's a free program to the RM and it's paid through a possible criminal record check portal for an online application if the RM chooses to go that route. Provides residents with the opportunity to just do a criminal record check online through the RM's website instead of attending the RCMP. It also reduces the amount of criminal record checks the RCMP would have to do. So there would be a charge to the online criminal record checks. The RM gets a portion of every criminal record check that gets submitted through the portal and then that's how the camera registry program is, is, is paid for.",

This was a previous council decision that was made during the development agreement negotiations because of the size of the lots. So the developer was on side with this parking restriction being implemented. Now, when people buy lots, it's up to either the developer, the builder, the real estate agent to provide this information to buyers. Apparently not everyone was aware of these restrictions, so now they're living with that restriction without knowing it at the time of purchase. So we did send out a letter to the 18 properties on Dogwood Drive. We received 15 letters back and we basically asked them if they supported amending the development agreement to allow parking on one side of the street. Fourteen were in support of the amendment, one was against the amendment, and three we did not hear back from. So we're just providing this information to council at this point. If council wants to provide direction to amend this development agreement, we can definitely bring that back to a future council meeting for council to vote on.

Councilor Ward 2, Andy Kaczynski. Councilor Ward 3, Mark Miller. Councillor Ward 4 is Melinda Warren. Can I get approval of the agenda mover and a seconder for that, please? Sorry. Melinda and Glenn, any additions, modifications at all to the agenda? I see none. Then I'm going to show hands those in support of approval agenda that's unanimous and is carried. Approval of the the minutes. Can I get a mover and a seconder for that as well, please? Melinda and Glenn, any additions to that? Andy? Hi. I want to ask that on the last meeting I asked for the accounts from which one we took the money for SSHI and the comment was from your accounts. But we still didn't receive that information to council. Yeah, I've requested that from finance. So I'll follow up on those on that information and how long going to. Take because it's already a month. So. Yep, I'm not sure. I will follow up with them and and get a timeline and get that information to council. Okay, thank you. Any other comments or additions for the approval of the agenda or the minutes? Sorry, none. Then I gotta show hands those in support of the approval of the committee of the whole minutes, November 12, 2024, that is unanimous and is carried. And then we'll go to a question period there and 15 minutes and obviously it's going to be somebody online there. Janet, you want to go first? Go ahead. Hello, my name is Janet Nyland and I'm from Oak Bank. I have one question. It's item 8.2. It's your schedule of council meetings. I noticed that there are 11 canceled meetings for next year. I'm wondering why they're not being rescheduled as they have been done in other other times. I'll refer that to our CEO. At this point, we're just laying out the proposed schedule for council to review. Cancellations obviously are related to holidays or different conferences that council attends to. So typically closer to those dates, if we want to change say a committee of the whole to a council meeting, if it's needed. Or vice versa. We can do that closer to by separate resolution. Well, that might work for you and maybe for council, but it's very awkward for citizens to know when meetings are going to be held and to plan to attend. Previously you had often maybe a month or two ahead, put in alternate dates. Like for example, January 7th. Could it not be moved to another date? There's more and more cancellations now. If Tuesday isn't going to be a suitable day because of conflict with other things, maybe council reviews their organizational bylaw and changes the date they meet to Wednesday, for example, like other municipalities. I'm just saying that 11 meetings in a year seems like an awful lot to council. Does council agree with that or is, are they willing to work with that? That's what we're going to discuss coming up here, but I, I personally haven't got a problem with that. It's just the way the schedule is. Sometimes we're not able to have those meetings to reschedule them. As our CEO said, we could, we could do that maybe later on as it gets closer, but that's just the time of this time of the year where it falls on. So other councils and other RMs you refer to them, who are you referring to? Well, a lot of council meetings are on Monday nights or on Wednesday nights. They don't have to be on Tuesday. If, if, if you're conflicting with a lot of other organizational meetings, it's something that council can look into. I, I mean already the, the meetings are getting shorter and opportunities for the public are getting reduced. I just think this is one more step in reducing public involvement with council. I would really appreciate you looking into alternatives for, other than just simply canceling 11 meetings. Well, that's 11 of how many meetings and that's for the entire year. So I personally don't see a big issue with regards to that. And like I say, council is going to discuss that later on. But your note is noted. There are 10 council meetings out of 24 year counseling. There's one planning meeting, so I'm just. Oh, pardon me. Some are committee of the whole, but so maybe it's nine and council meetings are important. I would suggest if you cancel a council meeting, maybe refer it to a committee of the whole date as they seem to be shorter and not as complicated or involved for the public. My comments are noted. Thank you. Thank you. Anybody else for questions there? Daniel? Good afternoon, My name is Daniel Page. I'm your computer science professor over on Pine Ridge Road. So I'm Coming to ask questions about something that's happened before. And again, my first question is. So I'm looking at the minutes from November 12, 2024, the ones that were just approved. Now, from what I know my counselor had passed along some comments and concerns around those minutes. Were those received by counsel? Yes. I speak for myself. Everybody else got it? Yes. So my. My second question is, is I'm looking at the minutes that are on the ARM website just at this moment, and there's a number. There's at least two spelling mistakes down to the point of just straight up typos. And I have concerns that the minutes aren't being given the care that they are needed for accuracy. My question is, I prepared very carefully a document and I gave it to my counselor, including it gave down to the edits, the individual edits of specific parts for my part of the question period from that. From that meeting where there's some. Again, there's inaccuracies on what was said and what I said and what I inquired and asked about. I wanted to ask counsel, why are you like, why wasn't this considered and put before counsel and tried to improve the document. Councillor Kaczynski sent it to us. Maybe he can answer your question there. Andy, thank you. Yeah. I was pointing out that once we send that corrections to the minutes, they should be corrected and represented through meaning of what the residents are presenting to us, not whatever we are. I don't know who take the minutes and, you know, interpreted the minutes. So I agree with Dr. Page that we should make those correction and, you know, make sure that going forward we we having correct minutes of the council meeting. Thank you, mark. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I would echo what Councillor Kaczynski just said, but I actually think there might have been an administrative error in the submission of those corrections because I have the document in front of me that Colleen may have received, and it says corrections for minutes for November 14, 2024. So I have those in front of me, and I. I think they're meant for November 12th, right? 10Th. Yeah. No, 12th. Okay. So I think it's just a potential oversight, but maybe the CEO can speak to that concern. I think we received the email from Councillor Kaczynski yesterday, Correct? Yes. With the requested changes I forward. There's onto. The assistant CAO re reviewed them. We did correct a spelling mistake that was pointed out, but we feel like. Question period. We've said this before. It's not a verbatim. You know, we try to summarize, at best, the context that we we hear from the person. We always refer people to the audio if they want to hear exactly what's spoken or they can attend the meeting in person. But we do our best to summarize the content that's provided during question period. And if I can add to that, that was going to be my reply. It's the letter from or the email from the MSO. That's the Municipal Service Officer there. We answered Mr. Page's comments last time there and I'll answer them again. The points made are minutes are not a legal document and are not laid out the way they that way in the Municipal Act. Municipal act only references that the CEO must ensure that the minutes of every council meeting are made without note or comment. Minutes should be verbatim and that they should not reference individual points made, personal observations or opinions made by council members. Minutes should not record a debate on the outcome. Decisions, resolutions, reports and documents attached to the agenda show the information that was considered leading to the decision made. Question period should not be on the agenda. Personal opinions, judgments or comments made by the attendees should should be avoided and not included in the minutes. As for your your comments there November 14th, I guess we, we now know it's the 12th. So you know, you notice you note in dark blue or additional materials and comments to consider. That's not up to you, Mr. Page, to make those additions to that. We looked at the minutes there and the minutes as per our Municipal Service Officer. They're fine with me and have been for the two years that we've been here, plus many, many years before that. That we're not going to change the aspect of the minutes. The minutes are just that. They're just a scope of what was reiterated on a certain minute of meetings or one meeting in this case here. And the change it now I think is no is not something we want to do. Spelling errors, although it should be avoided, is at the very best a point. It does not take away from the meaning unless this is a legal document, something like a search warrant or warrant to obtain and so on like that. Spelling errors are critical. This doesn't rise to that occasion. I hope that ANSWERS your question, Mr. Page. It doesn't to be honest. But one more question. You use the word verbatim and now I'm an academic. I understand what that word means. Can you explain to council what you mean by verbatim? Because I don't understand what you mean by verbatim. What is the definition of verbatim that you're using? I don't Know, I could get, I can get on Google here and look for verbatim. But I'll tell you what I think it is. Verbatim is exactly what was stated. If I what I just said in the two seconds here, it'll. It'll have every F and so on. Like that lady in the RM here has every that I say in. During my conversations. Well, that's verbatim, everything exactly as stated. These are points that we want to get across. Just so I guess I'll just ask one more question then. So just to be clear, I don't understand how any of the comments I have here, these are. Well, first, just for context, because not other people have this. Other people don't have this document. The first set of blue text just for context for council, that's justifications for the changes needed on my question period comments because they are inaccurate and they make a logical lot make a lot of logical assumptions that aren't actually true. And likewise you wouldn't know what document I was talking about if you actually looked at the segment that's actually there. And it twists a couple of things I did say. That's just a matter of truth. The second set of blue comments, those are ones just meant to help because there's comments, there's just lack of information on those components. But indeed there's two typos. Just to be very clear, they're not actually changed in the minutes that are actually on there right now that I just loaded up just for context. But my final question is very simple, is, does accuracy of minutes matter to council? You know, I think it rises to spelling errors. I don't think that's. Although it should be avoided, it's not fatal at any aspect of this at all. It doesn't take away from the minutes at all. We'll try to avoid spelling errors. Mark. Thank you Mr. Mayor. And thank you Dr. Page, for your comments on this because I think it's critical. I belong on a number of national and other boards and things like that. So we have a minute book. A minute book is a legal instrument that is a record of a recorded meeting. So I would differ with what was just explained and I would say that minutes are absolutely critical in being accurate, precise and just. And so yeah, my point of view is just one shared amongst five people here, but I think they could be enhanced and I really, really appreciate you taking the time and effort to submit your corrections to council because I think it'll also stand as a record and it should be tabled and put as A record for what the public has seen in this case. But minutes can always be improved. You know, the old moral of teaching as you know for things like this is record less and then you have less to be accountable for. I don't like that motto. I think you should record more and provide more detail and precision to, to really give the tone. As you said you felt that you were misrepresented. I know in 7.3 as well. I think some of my points weren't captured because I don't know that I think there is misrepresentation of information out there. But it goes on both sides. Right. You can't just accuse one side of providing misinformation when. Because it becomes very biased and very. How can I say one sided and so. Absolutely. But you know, at the end of the day I hope we can do a better job in recording minutes. Thank you. And I'll end this off. We run out of. Andy, you got something? Go ahead. Yes, I want to pointed out that if resident think that he was not correctly coded then he have all the rights to, you know, make a statement and correct them. And we should accept that as a truth because if we can go back to the minutes what was said to the audio and see what he said and what. What's the problem to keep changing them so the residents feel like, you know, he wasn't miscoded and everything what was said by him, it's there according to the, you know, being truthful. Thank you. Okay, I'll. I'll. I'll quickly summarize this and then we'll carry on. This is the second time where Dr. Page has made comments with regards to the minutes aren't correct. I said it last time there and I'm not going to reread the points there. The way we've been doing it I would say for decades has worked fine. I don't see any necessity to change it whatsoever. If there's something in here that's totally beyond the problematic stage goes against that totally wrong and this doesn't rise level at all, then we'll. One thing, I do agree that there are some spelling errors but I don't find that's a big deal whatsoever. It happens and maybe we'll try to not have these spelling errors there but they don't. They don't take away from the. The document. I think we'll cut that off now because we're well over our time here and then we'll go to any other. Is that 15 minutes for sure? Isn't it okay then why don't we go to the agenda there. Let me find my notes. No delegations, no unfinished business. Why don't we get to 8.1 there? That's camera inventory program. Could I get a mover to seconder please? Melinda and Glenn. So this is for information, I believe Sergeant Turner is going to come up and see, speak about the document to council, if that's okay. Just generally, if you could describe to council what exactly this inventory program is about, how you came to know about it and others that are doing it and what the benefit might be. Sure, yeah. So while attending the Manitoba Association Chiefs of Police fall meeting, a company called Forest Green did a presentation and they provide solutions to police just to help us do our job better. One of the programs they pitched was a safe neighborhood camera registry program. So what it does is provides a link onto the RM's website where residents can go on onto the secure login information. They'd have that and then they could whether or not they have a public facing camera and whether or not they're willing to share that information with police should a crime occur in that area. So the police would have the login and we would get little bubbles all over the RM showing where a camera is and that would limit our time going door to door to, you know, do knock and talks to see if cameras are available. And I had an incident with this over the weekend about a missing person and we spent about two and a half hours going door to door Oak Bank. So this could limit some of that time and just go to targeted houses. That could help. It's a free program to the RM and it's paid through a possible criminal record check portal for an online application if the RM chooses to go that route. Provides residents with the opportunity to just do a criminal record check online through the RM's website instead of attending the RCMP. It also reduces the amount of criminal record checks the RCMP would have to do. So there would be a charge to the online criminal record checks. The RM gets a portion of every criminal record check that gets submitted through the portal and then that's how the camera registry program is, is, is paid for. Questions? Any questions from council? Glenn first Yeah, I think it's a good thing, especially with what happened in New York here just recently. I'm sure they went through a whole bunch of videos to find the gentleman that shot that CEO. And I realize that that's us but Canada can be the same with things happening and why not put a program. Together that helps that and Just also to side note, I did consult the RCMP here and there's no problem with them putting a third party criminal record check option. The only thing that that link would not provide is a vulnerable sector check which they would still have to attend the RCMP for. Mark. Thank you Mr. Mayor. Thank you for bringing this forward to council. Having returned from Nairobi, Kenya not too long ago, they have cameras everywhere and they implement this now as you know as a, as a police official, enforcement officer, you know that this doesn't prevent crime but it helps facilitate capturing as Councilor Fuel just indicated. Having said that, does it breach on any personal privacy issues? No, no. The feeds and the rec, the video is not stored on the website whatsoever. All it is is just you fill out an application saying that you are willing to share your information with the police and it just provides a little bubble on a map. That's all it does. It doesn't. They, they're not required to testify. Should we pull any video they can remove themselves from the camera registry program at any time with no penalty. So in your opinion would it be a strong, strong element to support the enforcement or the capture or the investigation that you have going forward? Absolutely it would, it would streamline our investigation greatly because we don't have to drive around looking for cameras. We potent, we still will because not everybody will use the service but it can target us to go to certain locations instead of kind of doing a door to door and I think it would facilitate that. I have an organization that's on Main street in Winnipeg and there was a murder not far from the premise and the police asked to use our camera for the investigation which led to the apprehension of the individual. So we, I think this would absolutely facilitate that as long as there's no privacy breach or anything that we. Not at all. The cam, the video footage doesn't get uploaded onto this site. It's literally just I live at 123 Main street and I have a ring doorbell camera on my garage and I'm willing to share the information. That's, that's all we get. Thank you for your information. Once again thank you for bringing this forward. Welcome. See I, I, I see a bit of a problem with it. There's lots of positives but it says, it says in there and I read it the aspect there that they're trying to get. It's a business first of all for this criminal records check but local indices has to be done at the, that the detachment and that's, this is a CPIC issue there. The, the Fact that it states that there will not be required for court. This is a murder something in in the. The range nothing higher than a murder defense can can look the. To contest the. The downloading and giving it to the police. That's my problem. So it's, it's not. It's. It's accurate because 99 out of 100 times all it is is going to be looking for the missing person. Although that's extremely important. It comes down to a murder there then the guarantee the defense is going to want to know from whose house it came from from what kind of computer has it been tampered with in the whole nine years. Because if that's integral to. To an investigation they're going to be seizing the. The hard drive. So I, I don't want to get into the weeds of that but everything else like is an exceptional idea and I, I commend you for doing that. So that one little nuance there the proprietary rights and so on to. To. To that event that I guess that we could. That could be figured out later on and I don't want to make one small thing or blurb that will happen, you know. You know like once in every 100 years or something like that. I shouldn't say that because it happens more often than not. But still that, that's not accurate in my opinion. Not totally accurate I should say. But for what it does it solves a lot of problems. So I'm very much for that. Any other questions at all? Yeah. Thank you for presentation. So can we make as a pilot project in our industrial area and see how that works if we have camera. There like through this business? Yeah, I'm not sure if they would just do it to a specific location. I could, I could ask them but that the Transcon industrial park being part of the municipality would have access just like a resident in Oak bank or an OLA would. So all the businesses could. Could link that they have cameras as well. Because I, I remember we have meeting with the you know owners of the businesses there and we kind of suggested to them that to place some cameras there. So you know. Yeah, I was going to mention that following that know they were looking at you know a neighborhood watch program and I. We would offer this service to that area as well. So anyone that has a camera could register their camera could work with Springfield police and the rcmp. I know there's other communities using this. Do you recall Morton Altona are using it and I think they're getting verdant on board right now. And the criminal record checks are done through Brandon Police Service. Through this company here. Yeah. They partner with Brandon Police to do the criminal record checks. I've been out of the game for a while. But does it not have to be done at your detachment level? No, it can be done online. Like if you Google criminal record check for the RMS Ringfield right now, you can even do one on the commission errors website. Cool. Right? It's just there's a cost to it. Yeah. So it depends if you want to do it online or. Or in person at the detachment. But local indices checks are done here. Vulnerable sector checks would be done. Vulnerable sector checks would be done here. So the online portal would not allow you to get a vulnerable sector. So if you require that for your volunteer, your employment, whatever, you would still need to attend the RCMP detachment. So how much does this cost, the registry and stuff like that? The municipality? Yeah. Nothing. They make their money if somebody utilizes the criminal record check portal. Right. Because there's a cost to the resident to get a criminal record check. The arm gets a portion, Brandon police get a portion, and the company gets a portion. But there's no annual cost to the artist, to the rm to partner up with them, basically. So all the same neighborhood, the business there knows that there's a camera at 123 Main street and 223 Main street and so on like that. Okay. There's no cost for the camera program. Like I said, it's. It's. It's a subsidy of the criminal record check program. Can you elaborate more what kind of record check you're gonna do to. For residents so they are aware about it, if they're listening. Just a criminal record check. As. As a whole, you know, hockey teams, if you're volunteering for a hockey team, you need a criminal record check. You need a vulnerable sector check. Certain employment needs a criminal record check. And all we do is just run the criminal history. The RCMP does it right now. Thank you. Any other questions? All right, thanks, Sergeant. You're. You got the next one, Scott. Then you got the other one here. I'm just kidding. Okay, why don't we go to item 8.2. That's proposed council schedule. Mover in the second for that, please, Melinda and Glenn. So we've just laid out the 2025 proposed council schedule. Just basically looking at any conferences that we're aware of throughout the year, obviously holidays that affect the council schedule. So hearing that there's concerns with the number of council meetings being canceled, Council's never asked us to look at different days of the week. Typically when you have a conference like an amm, it's, you know, two or three days. So it's hard to even reschedule that council meeting during that week when council's attending these conferences. But we're open to council suggestions. If you feel there's too many cancellations or you want to look at alternate dates, typically we'll change a committee of the whole to a council meeting or reschedule to a later week if we can, during that month. Mark? Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm not opposed to canceling these meetings because I think to some degree, if we add on items to the next agenda, it usually doesn't cause too much havoc for most part. In fact, some of our meetings are quite short. And in the instance that there is a overloaded agenda, is it not possible then that we as council can interject and say, hey, maybe we do need a meeting prior to, or add a meeting as we go, but just to have a meeting, just to, you know, for a half an hour to an hour or whatever, just to say we had a meeting, I don't think there's any value to that, like, to be honest. Yeah, we can book special meetings and different situations where there's timelines or our meetings just don't line up. We can book a special meeting at any time and give that advertisement to the public. So. Andy, can I get explanation why we canceling January 7th? Are we still on holidays. So staff do not come back to the office till January 2? And because we closed for that stretch between the 24th and the 2nd, there might not be a lot of business for us to add to that first meeting. So we just. We had talked to council previously about possibly extending that break with council meetings, and there was general agreement. So this is just proposed. If you want to have that January 7th meeting, we can definitely book that. So can administration work on it for that meeting before the Christmas and have something on agenda? If presidents complain, then we should, I guess, you know, respond to it. And I, I haven't had any complaints. The only complaint we've had is from Mrs. Nyland there. If there's not enough for January 7th to make it a worthwhile meeting, I, I don't see any issue why we would, we would do something to add it as much on there when there's nothing to be added. You know what I mean? If it's going to be a short, short meeting, then a meeting for the sake of a meeting is, is. Is not productive time. I I feel like. Glenn. Yeah, I was just going to say the same thing, that a meeting to just. Just to have a meeting, for a meeting doesn't make sense to me. I would sooner have a special meeting put in or a scheduled meeting ahead to be added when there's lots on the agenda, then there's more sense to adding that, in my opinion, just to have a meeting. I don't see a reason just to have a meeting if there's nothing on there. Thank you. And I know how we. How we know now that they're not going to be nothing on for the meeting. We determine now already that there is not going to be nothing for that meeting. That's what Colleen was saying. We have two more meetings this year, January or September. Sorry, December 17th and 19th, the planning meeting, and then we close from the 24th to the second. So I know other staff members are extending their holidays to that full week. So I'm not going to have a lot of staff reports or requests for that January 7th meeting. So if council has items, I'm not aware of them, but send them to me and we can look at booking that meeting if it's required. Okay. Thank you. Go ahead, mark. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I just want to add to what has been said here, is that very rarely, in fact, of all of our meetings, I don't think we've ever gone to the limit. Maybe one time to 10 or 10:30, so we can always load up the meeting. I mean, I, I don't. It's more a use of our time and stuff, more efficiency. I. I would echo again what everybody's pretty much said here. Okay. I think that's basically it there, right? I know other rms and I hate using that term, other rms, because the only RM we're concerned about is ours. But that said, many take the summer off. We're too big and too busy for that. But I'm just to. You know, I hate the word canceled, but it's appropriate for this thing here. It's not that it's canceled, it's just that we're deferring it there because there's nothing to be added on there. And for the reasons AMM Planning Conference, FCM Conference, Remembrance Day and so on. That just the way that the schedule works in Canada Day. So that's the majority. If you had to look at all the reason, the rationale, it's not just because I feel tired today. I don't think we want to have a meeting. This is all supported cancellations. I just have one More point, if you don't mind. So obviously Mondays are not a great day because a lot of the holidays fall on the Mondays, so those don't work for council meetings. When we did committee appointments, we had asked council to provide us with all their committee dates that they meet. And I find a lot of those meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays already. So we're looking at your other committees that you sit on and a lot of the conflict. Tuesday seems to be the free day for council to meet, so that's why we haven't proposed and I don't believe council's looked at proposing a different date to meet. So. Okay, unless there's other questions, can I get a show of hands, those in support of the proposed council schedule changes as unanimous and carried. Then we'll get to 8.3. Can I get a mover in a seconder for Dogwood Drive parking restrictions? Melinda and Patrick. If council recalls, we had received some correspondence from a resident that lived on Dogwood Drive. Currently, there is parking restrictions within the development and servicing agreement for this street that does not allow parking on either side of the street. And so that's been causing, I guess, some concerns with residents and when they have visitors and they note it's the only street in Oak bank that has these restrictions. This was a previous council decision that was made during the development agreement negotiations because of the size of the lots. So the developer was on side with this parking restriction being implemented. Now, when people buy lots, it's up to either the developer, the builder, the real estate agent to provide this information to buyers. Apparently not everyone was aware of these restrictions, so now they're living with that restriction without knowing it at the time of purchase. So we did send out a letter to the 18 properties on Dogwood Drive. We received 15 letters back and we basically asked them if they supported amending the development agreement to allow parking on one side of the street. Fourteen were in support of the amendment, one was against the amendment, and three we did not hear back from. So we're just providing this information to council at this point. If council wants to provide direction to amend this development agreement, we can definitely bring that back to a future council meeting for council to vote on. So at this point, it's just for information for council. And if you want to direct us to bring it back, I would need that direction from council. Glenn? Yeah, so I've heard from a few residents in that area on that street, and I would recommend that we bring it back to look at the development agreement to be amended. I'M in support When I see 14 in support, three did not respond. So, you know, again, that's not a yes or a no and one being against. So I think it's pretty high. And then when I look at other streets for examples, I have done that also in other municipalities and I don't see a problem with having a sparking on one side of the street at this time. Mark. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'd like to support what Councilor Fuel recommends on this. Thank you. And for the record, I support it as well. Melinda's so that's unanimous. So then when we bring it back sometime in the future there, then we can discuss the. The changes. Yeah, we can add that to a future meeting then. Okay. Now we'll go to a close meeting. Can I get a mover in a second or go to the closed meeting, please? Melinda and Patrick and we'll go to closed meeting at 1:39pm thank you. We're going to come out of closed meeting at 2:08pm Can I get a mover in the second to come out of a closed meeting? Mark and Glenn and I've gotten rid of my agenda there. Oh, okay. Then we're prepared to adjourn. Nothing else to be added from close meeting. So at 208pM we'll adjourn as well. Thank you."
