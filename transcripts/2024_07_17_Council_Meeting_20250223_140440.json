Unanimous and is carried. The next one is a 10.2. That's stars. Can I get a mover and a secondary for that? Patrick, And Glenn, I had a comment here there. I'm a big proponent for stars. This is a vital component for our healthcare. I've had first hand experience with STARS in Manitoba. Air ambulances in the North Many communities in the north rely on air ambulance provided by the government either via airport helicopter and air ambulance, a propeller or jet when there's babies involved and adults alike. This is an extremely good tool for the health department and has been utilized in the ARM Springfield. And that's all I had to say with regards to that kind of get a mover or a show of hands of those in support of STARS that is unanimous and is carried Then if we can get to the thank you card of the SEI grad recipients and mover in a sector for 10.3 please Melinda and Andy at this point here we have the card from Layla plant there we increased the the amount to $750 from 500 and which I think is is was an excep from our deputy mayor to increase that because most of the honorary bursaries and so on are at that 750 level. And I'm not saying that we have to match costs there but it was really well received. The SCI staff principal Kevin Dell extremely large crowd present as every year and their families at the Club Region Casino which is an impressive facility but still not in our community. So it'll be nice to have the grad eventually be here at the our new recreational facility which requires our new water treatment plant to be able to operate and provide our community going forward. So appreciate the card from from Layla. It was very well done. Any other questions or comments from council at all? I see none. Can I get a show of hands of those in support of 10.3 thank you card unanimous and is carried. We'll get to a new business there. And that's the purchase of the asphalt hot box trailer mover and a seconder for that please. Linda and Andy. Any questions from council with regards to this? Do you have your hand up penny?\n\nSpeaker C: Yes Mr. Mayor. I would like to ask if we purchasing ourselves or we purchase using that company that helping purchase equipment through AMM or Canoe. Yeah, did they can help us with purchasing equipment. We never use them like purchasing the trucks or a fire department chassis and police car.\n\nSpeaker B: I believe the director of public works is online but I honestly don't think that the Industrial Machine Inc. Is part of that canoe procurement. They have to be a listed supplier. So maybe Blaine if you're able to confirm if that's an opportunity through canoe procurement or not.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah, yeah.\n\nSpeaker C: We did look into seeing if that was a listed can company and I.\n\nSpeaker A: Don'T believe they were.\n\nSpeaker C: So I'm not 100% sure if there.\n\nSpeaker A: Is any advantages for the municipality for canoe in this. In this equipment purchase, so.\n\nSpeaker C: Okay. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: Any other questions from council at all? I see none. Then if I can read the resolution.\n\nSpeaker B: Be it resolved. The council of the arm of Springfield approves the purchase of one new asphalt hot box trailer from Industrial Machine Inc.

The council of the ARM of Springfield approves the purchase of one new rehabilitation trailer from Propack for $59,630.27 US plus applicable taxes, transport fees and broker fees with funds to come from the vehicle and equipment reserve.\n\nSpeaker A: Are we able to amend the resolution to show Canadian funds beside it there? I think it's $80,000.\n\nSpeaker B: It's 5963720 US when we write the check, we have to get the exact US amount on that day of the check writing.\n\nSpeaker A: Oh, so that'll change.\n\nSpeaker B: It could change from what's being proposed right now.

The tax living grants in lieu have been collected, which accounts for our deficit. Can we have some clarification on this so there's. There's no misinformation with regards to that?

Can I get a show of hands those in support of list of accounts under 11.4 that is unanimous and is carried if we can get to 11.5. That's a non profit tax cancellation. Sunrise Performing Arts center of Excellence or space Mover. And a seconder for that. Please Patrick and Melinda be resolved the.\n\nSpeaker B: Council of the arm of Springfield approve a nonprofit organization grant for Springfield Performing Arts center of Excellence in the amount of $7,909.19.\n\nSpeaker A: I have a question about that. The taxes are 69.57 plus the arrears. That would take us to a ballpark of 7,100. But we're looking at $7,900 for that. Not sure what the math is there.\n\nSpeaker B: So the tax bill that council is seeing a copy of those arrears are not to date. So that was when the original bill was printed in July of 2023.\n\nSpeaker A: Oh, I see. So the 140 is still standing. So that's the 140. Okay.\n\nSpeaker B: But that's still 79 monthly penalties that have been accruing since that time.\n\nSpeaker A: Oh, so that's where the 79 is from.\n\nSpeaker B: Yep.\n\nSpeaker A: Okay. Any questions from council with regards to that?\n\nSpeaker C: Yes, I would like to ask if they always paying penalties they never come up with it or this is just the first time.\n\nSpeaker B: Yeah. So they were kind of in a strange situation where they were also renting additional space in the mall and owned this property as well. So they had come to council for a council cancellation of the property taxes. At that time, council didn't agree with the cancellation because the activities weren't taking place in the building on main Street. Now that they've, you know, gotten rid of their space in the mall, moved back to that building, they've come back to council and now it's council's opportunity to approve or deny again.\n\nSpeaker C: I know, but that's not what I ask. I ask you if they always on arrears.\n\nSpeaker B: No, they're not always in a rare.\n\nSpeaker C: Okay.\n\nSpeaker B: No, this is the first time.\n\nSpeaker C: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: Yeah. And as a council, we've had discussions about this in camera and out of camera there. But it's. It's to the point there would be no further assistance in my opinion. I got one vote there, but I think, uh, hopefully this helps there. But we have to take that into consideration there. Any other comments from council? I see none. Can I get a show of hands of those in support of the nonprofit taxation cancellation space? Unanimous. And it is carried. We'll get to 11.6. Letter of support for John Q. Built for a collaborative efficiency advocate position. Can I get a mover in a second with regards to that, please? Melinda and Glenn, any questions from council with regards to letter of support? Andy.\n\nSpeaker C: Mr. Mayor, I want to ask like they suggestion that we use this Efficiency Manitoba. We can. We can go directly ourselves to Efficiency Manitoba. We don't have to go through John Q.\n\nSpeaker A: No, but this is John Q. Asking that they're going to go align with Efficiency Manitoba. They've got a grant for 120,000 and the John Q will likely match that to a certain level. Yes, we could do that. And so anybody can use Efficiency Manitoba. But we're linking with Efficiency Manitoba, a government entity there, to get that special environmental incentive as well. They have a 5% MECD. I'm trying to remember what that acronym stands for, but it'll the. The structure. Our John Q Daycares are built better than the Manitoba Environmental Committee designations there. I believe that's what MACD stands for or something with regards to that. So MA Efficiency Manitoba and John Q with their daycare program is better than what the government is looking for. And Efficiency Manitoba will work with us to do even a better job. And this is aligning directly with them for our John Q. Built And John Q Daycare. So yeah, they, anybody can, you can as a small business and so on use them. But John Q has been using them and now they're looking to have a direct contact with them to make the initiatives that much better and just asking for support with regards to the green initiatives that Efficiency Manitoba will give to them as well. Because we're part of that group of the Winnipeg Metropolitan region. They're, they're throwing it out to surrounding areas of city Winnipeg.\n\nSpeaker C: Understand. But we kind of question what junk you did for us over the years. And they didn't do absolutely nothing till now. So we're paying the, you know, the bill for, for them like I don't know, $20,000 a year. And what are we getting in the return?\n\nSpeaker A: Well, we're, we're, I don't know if it's, it's a one time payment. What I understand is a $20,000 there. We're getting like daycare. That 39 acres of land that we, we bought there which was a very prudent good move on council's part there because that land is only going up in value. But we have no land for a daycare. This community needs a daycare as a high priority for allowing us to go forward there because the daycare is huge and just being a grandparent and with my sons and daughter in laws and my grandkids, it's a huge cost and location, location, location is paramount. And if we have this daycare like they have in East Selkirk, Loretta Henley in the city of Winnipeg, there's 20 plus these daycares around, they're, they're very efficient. There's actually a university, I know the name but I'm not going to mention the name that is doing a study with regards to our, our business initiative for that because it's, it's a global project that's getting a lot of insight from other entities there. And the, the energy efficiency coming from these buildings, the, the costs are, are streamlined and not to mention the environmental Green initiative is, is top. So we are, we are getting lots from this and John Q. We will approach them I hope once we get everything ready. Our water treatment plant up and running, uh there, uh, to allow our community to go forward and daycare is, is something that this community needs.\n\nSpeaker C: Nobody say that we don't need it but not necessarily the land would be purchased gonna go there. We have land that we want to build our water treatment plant and we didn't pay you know, absorbent amount of money for that land and we could have used that land for that purpose too. So it's not only just because we purchased the land. Just fits, you know, the bill for, for that daycare center.\n\nSpeaker A: We.\n\nSpeaker C: Nobody say that we don't need the daycare center, but you know, we, we have, we had the land to, to put the daycare center before now. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: Thank you. Any other questions from council at all then if I can get a. A vote or can I get the.\n\nSpeaker B: Resolution, be it resolved that the mayor be authorized to sign a letter of support for JQ Bilk for a collaborative advocate position on behalf of the ARM of Springfield.\n\nSpeaker A: I got a show of hands of those in support of a letter of support for John Q. That is Melinda, Glenn and Patrick. Those opposed, Mark and Andy. And is hereby carried 11.7 of Manitoba Municipalities Administrators review and revision. 11.7. A mover and a secondary for that, please. Melinda and Patrick. Any questions from council with regards to that? I can get the resolution read. Did you have a question, Andy?\n\nSpeaker C: Who structured this letter to us? Manitoba Municipality of Administrators.\n\nSpeaker B: Correct. Yep.\n\nSpeaker C: And what, what can you tell us about this organization?\n\nSpeaker B: Well, the mma. So Manitoba Municipal Administrators is kind of my AMM to council. So it's the organization I belong to and I have to get my professional credits through to good standing with them. So it's this group that was asked to put their, you know, comments regarding the municipal board mandate, role, function and practices. So they put together a resolution and sent it out to all the members and asked that we bring it forward to council for review. And if you want to vote on the resolution and provide it, that's an option. So.\n\nSpeaker C: So they stating here municipality and wasteful processes and their interaction municipal boards. So this have something to do with Bill 372?\n\nSpeaker B: Well, I think the province is doing a review of the Manitouba Municipal Board mandate. So they've reached out to certain groups to comment. And they reached out to MMA to comment on this.\n\nSpeaker C: Yeah, but this is how something to do with the Bill 37?\n\nSpeaker B: I don't know specifically. I don't think it does, but I can confirm. But the municipal board follows falls under a different act. So this is specific to the Municipal Board.\n\nSpeaker C: Okay, thank you.\n\nSpeaker A: Any other questions? Council, have you read the resolution yet?\n\nSpeaker B: No.\n\nSpeaker A: Do we have to read it aloud or can we agree to that? We read it.\n\nSpeaker B: I'll just read the Therefore be it resolved section. Therefore be it resolved that the AMM lobby the province of Manitoba to undertake a comprehensive review of the mandate role and function in the municipal board to Evaluate its relevance and actual value in today's municipal sector. And further, that the Province of Manitoba complete a third party value for money service delivery, review of the municipal board processes and undertake process improvements to streamline functions, reduce red tape and reduce municipal costs. And further, that the Province of Manitoba engage AMM and MMA to participate as key stakeholders in the preparation of terms of reference for these efforts and any steering or oversight body for this work.\n\nSpeaker A: With the resolution read.
